**Vagrant box configuration**
1. Uses a _debian/buster64_ distribution of Linux
2. Two network interfaces are configured
   * One private interface, with a predermined IP (here _192.168.56.80_)
   * One public interface, on the host eno1 network interface, with a predermined IP (here _192.168.1.7_)
3. Calls a few different scripts that we will explain later on
